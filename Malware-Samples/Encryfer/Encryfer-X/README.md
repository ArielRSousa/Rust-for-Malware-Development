**Encryfer-X** is a malicious software written in **RUST**, designed to encrypt files on an infected system. Once executed, it recursively scans the system for files and applies a strong encryption algorithm to render them inaccessible. To recover the encrypted files, a decryption tool is required.

Algorith Used : AES256 + chacha20poly1305

### Functionality of this Ransomware

* File Encryption: Encrypor-X identifies and encrypts various file types, including documents, images, audio, and video files recursively at Volume Drives too.

* Ransom Note: After encryption, the ransomware typically creates a ransom note containing instructions on how to obtain the decryption key. This note often demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key.

* Persistence: Encrypor-X may attempt to persist on the system by checking the following requirements: 
    * Checks if the file Runs under debug
    * Check if the file runs under VM's

**ONCE ENCRYPTED YOU CAN'T DECRYPT IT WITHOUT THE DECRYPTED SOFTWARE WITH PROPER KEY SO SAVE THE KEY WITH PRECAUTION ;)**

You need the Following 2 THings: AES wit 32.len() + Encrypted Hex Value that contains AES256 with chacha !.
